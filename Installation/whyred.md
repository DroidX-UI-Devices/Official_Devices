• If you got bootloop, try format data again from ofox Recovery

• If you have been done repartitioning process to install some rom port before, please revert back to original partition if you haven’t done it

• If want to install magisk, at least complete first setup (if you clean flash before)

• Not all kernel build is compatible for this build, just make sure if the kernel is supporting dynamic partition (ask the kernel developer)

• The step for installing kernel is same as magisk step above
